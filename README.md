The Simon Project was created to shed some light over Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) Internet connectivity. LAC countries are sometimes geographically close to each other, but network-wise very distanced. This logical distance that separates LAC countries has a considerable impact on Internet quality, and therefore on the region's economical development.
